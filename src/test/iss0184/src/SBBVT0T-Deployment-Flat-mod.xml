<!-- For some reason the unit test doesn't resolve the URI against
     the correct base URI. So this is tweaked to pass. It's possible
     that Xerces makes two attempts, first without resolving against
     the base URI and the again resolved if necessary. But if the
     first attempt doesn't succeed, the "\"s cause it to fail. -->
