/** The resource resolver interface.
 *
 * <p>On the one hand, the {@link Resolver} class in this API is a concrete class, not suitable
 * for independent implementation. But on the other, it's widely used and can be instantiated
 * from just its class name. (So it's handy as the name of a resolver class passed on the
 * command line or in a configuration file.)</p>

 * <p>Further complicating matters, there are conflicting interfaces for doing resolution.
 * In particular, the {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLResolver} and
 * {@link org.xml.sax.ext.EntityResolver2} interfaces
 * can't be implemented by the same class.</p>
 *
 * <p>This interface is an attempt to abstract away from the existing interfaces and expose
 * something that could be implemented independently that provides enough functionality t
 * implement all of the common resolver interfaces.</p>
