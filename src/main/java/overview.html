<p>An OASIS XML Catalog resolver.</p>

<p>This API implements a catalog-based resolver for URIs. It’s
designed to work in the context of XML processes, resolving external
identifiers for parsers and URIs for other processes (XML Schema
validation, RELAX NG validation, transformations, querying etc.).</p>

<p>This JavaDoc is for the version 6.0.11 API.</p>

<p>By providing <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/14809/xml-catalogs.html">an OASIS XML Catalog</a> file that maps URIs, for example,
from web resources to local resources, you can improve the performance
of your processes and remove dependence on external web servers.</p>

<p>For most users, the {@link org.xmlresolver.XMLResolver} and
{@link org.xmlresolver.tools.ResolvingXMLReader} classes are all that's
needed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: As published, this JavaDoc is designed to help you understand the
public APIs. Some parts of the implementation are excluded because they don’t
form part of the useful “user” API. If you’re interested in integrating the
resolver into other applications, you may wish to look at a more
comprehensive description of the API.
